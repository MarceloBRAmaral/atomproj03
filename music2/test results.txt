- test with .mp3 sound
- when added loop to the audio, consider after / (actually I can't produce an mp3 file without
empty spaces at the beginning and at the end with audacity - waiting for another audio editor)

Android:

- chrome: music plays
- firefox: music doesn't play
- opera mini: asks for what to do with mp3 files, and doesn't play in the browser 

Desktop:

- firefox: music plays
- chrome: music plays
- opera: music plays

iPhone:
- chrome: music doesn't play
- firefox: music doesn't play
- safari: music doesn't play
- opera: music doesn't play
